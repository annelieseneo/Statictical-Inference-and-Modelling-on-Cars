1. Describe concepts of probability, probability models, random variables, expected value and variance, descriptive statistics, and statistical inference.

2. Apply the statistical concepts learnt in simple problem solving related to computing using R program

Task Highlights :

ChickWeight

The ChickWeight dataset is a data frame which represents the progression of weight of several chicks. The little chicklings are each given a specific diet. There are four types of diets and the farmer wants to identify the one that fattens the chicks the fastest. Analyze and visualize the ChickWeight data in R using Descriptive Statistics. The three most common descriptive statistics methods, namely measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and measures of association should be used to analyze the ChickWeight data numerically and graphically. Analyze the ChickWeight data critically using appropriate method.

(a) Analyse the R built-in ChickWeight data and specify the variables.

(b) Find the dimension of the ChickWeight data.

(c) Identify the type of the ChickWeight data variables which are in columns.

(d) Develop a frequency distribution table for the attributes.

(e) Find the measures of central tendency of ChickWeight data features.

(f) Find the measures of dispersion of ChickWeight data attributes.

(g) Find the skewness of ChickWeight data features.

(h) Calculate correlations for each pair of attributes in ChickWeight data.

(i) Visualize the ChickWeight data variables using appropriate graphs.

(j) Develop a prediction model and discuss the performance of the model critically.



Cars

The period between 1970 and 1982 marked a significant shift in the United States car industry. American production shifted from heavy, powerful six and eight cylinder cars with poor gas mileage to lighter, less powerful, four cylinder cars with higher fuel efficiency. The global auto industry raised overall miles per gallon (MPG) by focusing on four cylinder cars and making them more fuel efficient. Hence, examine various carsâ€™ features using the mtcars dataset. Develop a prediction model to investigate the performance of cars.

(a) Analyse the R built-in mtcars data and specify the variables.

(b) Find the dimension of the mtcars data.

(c) Perform exploratory data analysis, including descriptive statistics.

(d) Visualize the data features using appropriate graphs.

(e) Develop a prediction model.

(f) Evaluate the model and discuss the performance of the model critically.

(g) Estimate 5 points using the developed model.
